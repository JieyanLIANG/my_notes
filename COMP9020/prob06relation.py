#Problem Set 6 Old Version

#Exercise 1
P: partial order--> R+AS+T 
Q: quasi-order(strict partial order)-> AR+AS+T

P diff Q --> Identity Order
The diag of matrix is the solution

#Exercise 2
ARB iff |A and B|>=1
I have seen this question in last problem set, the soultion is 
when every two in A/B/C are not disjoint
then |A and B|, |B and C|, |C and A| are all >=1
thus ARB,BRC-->CRA 

#Exercise 3
Partial order: R+AS+T
Total order: R+AS+T+Identity
Equivalent: R+S+T

R: xRx for all x in R
AR: no xRx exists
S: for all xRy we can get yRx
AS: if xRy and yRx we can get x=y 
T: if xRy and yRz we can get xRz
I: for all x in R and y in R we can get either xRy or yRx

#Exercise 4

we can see this in last problem set!
