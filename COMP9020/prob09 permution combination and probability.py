#Exercise 1
Still has some questions

#Exercise 2
1. 5^k
2. 5*4*3
3. 4*4*4*4
4. 4^5-4^4

#Exercise 3
1. ab or ba
    2*5!
2. 6!-2*5!
3. cab or bac
    6!-2*4!

#Exercise 4
P(S or J)=150/200
P(S)=85/200
P(S and J)=60/200
P(J)+P(S)-P(S and J)=P(S or J)
P(J)=150+60-85

#Exercise 5
1. every letter has 4 choices
    4^12
2. choose 8 letters and put them in mailbox with 2 of each
    then put the other 4 in either of mailboxs

    8: C(12,8)*C(8,2)*C(6,2)*C(4,2)*C(2,2)
    4: 4^4
    Solution: C(12,8)*C(8,2)*C(6,2)*C(4,2)*C(2,2)*4^4
#Exercise 6
1. (5*4*3*2)/(5^4)
2. (3^4)/(5^4)
3. (2*4*4*4)/(5^4)

#Exercise 7
1. 
    (6,1-5)
    (5,1-4)
    (4,1-3)
    (3,1-2)
    (2,1)

    Solution: (5+4+3+2+1)/(6^2)

2. 
    (6,3)
    (4,2)
    (2,1)
    Solution: 3/36

#Exercise 8
1/2
independent event
